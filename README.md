# Chatbot
A Deep learning based chatbot based on Neural Conversation Model.
This Project is a chatbot powered by deep learning and trained on data from Cornell built on
TensorFlow v1.5.1and Python v3.6.4 and is based on conversational modelling. Conversational
modelling is one of the most exciting problems in the field of Natural Language Processing. Our
approach is based on producing answers given by a probabilistic approach to maximize the
correctness of answer in the given context.

#SOFTWARE AND TOOLS
NLTK
Tensorflow
Seq2Seq model

#Datasets
We trained our model on the OpenSubtitles dataset by Tiedemann . This dataset consists of
movie conversations in XML format.
